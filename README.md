# Measuring Real-Time Tasks Execution Time in VxWorks

This project measures the execution times of Real-Time, preemptive
tasks in VxWorks. The execution times are calculated using a time
function that runs at the kernel level; the code recording the timestamps
is triggered by a context-switch hook.

VxWorks functions are used in this code for kernel programming.


This was an academic project for a Real-Time Systems & Embedded Programming class.
